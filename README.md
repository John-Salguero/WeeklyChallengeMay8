both code challenges uses command line inputs to input the numbers. The command line input only should have the input to the program.
1) Median of Two Sorted Arrays
Runtime: O(log (m+n))
input is
#ofelements elements #ofelements2ndlist elements2ndlist
example:
2 1 3 1 2
is
[1, 3] and [2]


2) Merged Sorted Lists
Runtime: O(n log k)
where n is the total number of elements in all the input lists, and k is the number of input lists
input is:
[[elements],[elements]....]
example:
[[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]
